This is an example plugin for Tarrasque App, showcasing how to use the [Tarrasque SDK](https://github.com/tarrasqueapp/sdk) to build your own plugins.

# Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.12.1 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v8.8.0 or higher)

# Setup

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

# Usage

To use the plugin in a development environment:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command lauches a local server and continuously recompiles the plugin on change. You can add this plugin to Tarrasque App by pointing it to http://localhost:5173/manifest.json in the plugin manager.
